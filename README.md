# Headless Wordpress with Bootstrap Vue
In this exploration of using Wordpress with as the Content Management System for a custom Bootstrap Vue front end, I've created a website for the non-profit organization Cascade Service Dogs. The page content (text and images) are sourced from Wordpress. The content of the site navigation and footer are written into the Vue.js code.
